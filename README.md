To run this project with minimal issues, you will need `python3`, `pip` and `virtualenv` in your system.

In Linux, they can be installed by the following commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip install virtualenv
```

Once these are installed, run the script `create_env` (from the appropriate folder, 'linux' or 'windows').
This will create a virtual environment and install all the dependencies, including `Jupyter Notebook`.

Finally, run the script `launch_notebook`  (from the appropriate folder, 'linux' or 'windows'), to launch Jupyter.
